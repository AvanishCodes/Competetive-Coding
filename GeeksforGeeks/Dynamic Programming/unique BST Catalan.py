"""Total number of possible Binary Search Trees with n different keys (countBST(n)) = Catalan number Cn = (2n)!/(n+1)!*n!

For n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … values of Catalan numbers are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …. So are numbers of Binary Search Trees.

Unique BST's 
Given an integer. Find how many structurally unique binary search trees are there that stores the values from 1 to that integer (inclusive). u
